Just a simple music player app with basic functionalities provided by the MediaPlayer class such as;
play, pause, repeat, shuffle, forward ,backward, previous, next.

The app scans the sdcard to filter all the files with ".mp3" extension, and puts them in a listview

Quite a lot of help were taken from Android-Developer sites and other blogs since I had absolutely no idea how to
implement MediePlayer class.

This app is just a building block for the music-streaming app that I initially planned on making, but lacked the knowledge in doing so. :'(
